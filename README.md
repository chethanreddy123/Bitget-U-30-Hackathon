## Introduction
Welcome to hAIr, an innovative HR Process Optimization application that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence to streamline and enhance HR operations. This project combines advanced language processing (Large Language Models), logic, and machine learning techniques to redefine traditional HR processes and create a more efficient and effective hiring process.

## Features
- **Job Description Generation:** Use the Palm LLM model to automatically generate job descriptions and provide suggestions for improvements.
- **Smooth Communication:** FastAPI ensures efficient communication between the frontend and backend components of the application.
- **Enhanced User Interface:** The frontend is developed using React, offering a user-friendly and interactive experience.
- **Secure Data Storage:** MongoDB is used to store job descriptions, CVs, and other important data securely.
- **NLP Enhancement:** Utilize spaCy and KOR for Named Entity Recognition and extracting key details from job descriptions and CVs.
- **Video Interview Analysis:** Employ OpenCV for analyzing facial expressions, FaceNet for recognizing facial features, and Assembly AI for audio sentiment analysis.
- **Accurate CV Ranking:** Utilize Jacard Similarity to rank CVs based on their alignment with job requirements.
- **Automated Email Notifications:** SMTP services automate email notifications for shortlisted candidates and HR stakeholders.
- **Real-time Insights:** A user dashboard provides real-time updates and insights into the hiring process.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and install the requirements
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install` from the front-end [link](https://github.com/SubhanuSRoy/hair-bitget).
3. Run the backend using FastAPI with `uvicorn MainRoutes:app --reload`.
4. Start the frontend using `npm start`.

## Usage
- Input job descriptions or titles and basic requirements.
- The application processes the data using AI techniques to generate and enhance job descriptions.
- CVs are ranked based on similarity scores and top candidates are shortlisted.
- Email notifications are sent to shortlisted candidates.
- User dashboard provides real-time updates and insights.
